While our app isn't exactly fully functional, the app was designed to be used to find the closest PG county establishments that offered free WiFi.

First, the user would enter in their current address, then the app would provide a list of establishments that were in close proximity (both on the scroll menu and as placeholders on the map). The output would include the exact distance away (in miles and minutes).

Finally, the user could click on a specific map placeholder, or location from the scroll down menu and get specific establishment information such as open/closing times and type of establishment.

For anyone who doesn't have an ISP or is frequently in need of WiFi connection, this app aims to make your life more simple!
