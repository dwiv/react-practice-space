# Information problem you're trying to solve
Our team attempted to solve the problem of not having access to WiFi connection.
We wanted to make finding a WiFi source more accessible/easy for information-seekers.

# Identified stakeholders/target browsers
The stakeholders for our project include those who do not have private access to high-speed Internet, business owners who offer free-WIFI, and PG county.

# Data you chose to work with
For our app, we chose to use a PG county WiFi dataset.

# Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem
We chose to solve the problem by creating an app that allows for a user to search/find all of the closest locations that offer free WiFi.

# Technical system decision rationale
For our app build, we chose to use React JS and Material UI.
We chose this framework because we felt that it provided a clean, modern look to our webiste. In addition, we felt that it would be good to challenge ourselves.. Not to mention the extra credit.

# How/if your final system helps to address the problem
Unfortunately, since our webapp isn't fully functional, our current system doesn't address the problem. However, if our final project was functioning, our final app WOULD address the problem, because it would streamline the process of finding the closest establishments that provided WiFi.

# Challenges faced and impact on final design
During the development of our app, many challenges were faced. Material UI and React were a pain to develop in, especially considering that none of us had any experience coding within these libraries. Coding in React is MUCH harder than coding bare JS is.
In addition, linking the webapp to the SQLite server and figuring out Page Routing were especially difficult for our team (We would fix these issues if we had more time). Lastly, our app couldn't perform quite as well as we hoped due to the limitations of our dataset (Ex. missing imoportant JSON location data needed for our app to function as intended).

# Possible future work directions with this problem
Going forward, we would like to iron out all the remaining kinks within our system's code. In addtion, we would also like to drop the PG County dataset, and use a broader/more robust dataset that would be more useful for our purposes.
